WebCamGadget
============

A Windows (Vista or 7) "Gadget" that displays a selected webcam.

**This project is still in development** (although what's posted so far is quite usable)

If you want to change the webcam that's being displayed, you have to hack the code 
(which is not particularly difficult). Currently that's hardcoded to point to a
webcam at Boeing Field, in Seattle. You only have to change a URL, and probably 
also the bounds of the HTML page, and you're good to go.

Things to Do
------------
1. Make the URL editable (and persistant).
1. Implement a scheme for selecting the 'zoomed' and 'un-zoomed' sizes. (I already have some preliminary code for this.)
